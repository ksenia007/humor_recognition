# Humor Project

This is a repository for Princeton COS598C final project, Spring 2020, taught by Prof. Danqi Chen. 

👉 In short, the project explored the performance of frozen/unfrozen pre-trained `BERT-base-uncased` models on the joke recognition, and the effect dataset formation has on the performance.
